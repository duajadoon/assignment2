        <p>Fast food is a type of food that is prepared and served within a few minutes. It is very convenient to buy it when you are busy and want to eat on the move running to the important meeting. As usually, there are proponents and opponents of such a convenience food. Of course, this so-called street food has its advantages and disadvantages. To pros, I would include the fact that it can spare the time of a lot of working mothers and fathers, who cannot find the time even to take a shower, to say nothing about the proper meal. There are also people, who travel on business and do not want to leave the car. The only thing they need to do is to approach a drive-through window and place an order. No need to browse a vast menu and wait for hours. The prices in such places are also very loyal due to the high-level competition. They also make their portions bigger in order to land customers and remain in the market.</p>
